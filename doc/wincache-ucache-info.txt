wincache_ucache_info

(PECL wincache >= 1.1.0)

wincache_ucache_info â€” Retrieves information about data stored in the user
cache

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array wincache_ucache_info ([ bool $summaryonly = false [, string $key ]]~
)~

Retrieves information about data stored in the user cache.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{summaryonly}

    Controls whether the returned array will contain information about
    individual cache entries along with the user cache summary.

{key}

    The key of an entry in the user cache. If specified then the returned
    array will contain information only about that cache entry. If not
    specified and {summaryonly} is set to FALSE then the returned array will
    contain information about all entries in the cache.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Array of meta data about user cache or FALSE on failure

The array returned by this function contains the following elements:

  * total_cache_uptime - total time in seconds that the user cache has been
    active
  * total_item_count - total number of elements that are currently in the user
    cache
  * is_local_cache - true is the cache metadata is for a local cache instance,
    false if the metadata is for the global cache
  * total_hit_count - number of times the data has been served from the cache
  * total_miss_count - number of times the data has not been found in the
    cache
  * ucache_entries - an array that contains the information about all the
    cached items:
      + key_name - name of the key which is used to store the data
      + value_type - type of value stored by the key
      + use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the
        opcode cache
      + last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for
        modifications
      + is_session - indicates if the data is a session variable
      + ttl_seconds - time remaining for the data to live in the cache, 0
        meaning infinite
      + age_seconds - time elapsed from the time data has been added in the
        cache
      + hitcount - number of times data has been served from the cache

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Using wincache_ucache_info()

<?php >
    wincache_ucache_get('green');
    wincache_ucache_set('green', 2922);
    wincache_ucache_get('green');
    wincache_ucache_get('green');
    wincache_ucache_get('green');
    print_r(wincache_ucache_info());
<?>

The above example will output:

Array
( ["total_cache_uptime"] => int(0)
  ["is_local_cache"] => bool(false)
  ["total_item_count"] => int(1)
  ["total_hit_count"] => int(3)
  ["total_miss_count"] => int(1)
  ["ucache_entries"] => Array(1)
    ( [1] => Array(6)
      (
        ["key_name"] => string(5) "green"
        ["value_type"] => string(4) "long"
        ["is_session"] => int(0)
        ["ttl_seconds"] => int(0)
        ["age_seconds"] => int(0)
        ["hitcount"] => int(3)
       )
    )
)
