variant_idiv

(PHP 5)

variant_idiv â€” Converts variants to integers and then returns the result from
dividing them

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed variant_idiv ( mixed $left , mixed $right )~

Converts {left} and {right} to integer values, and then performs integer
division.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{left}

    The left operand.

{right}

    The right operand.

    Note:

    As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this
    function can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point,
    boolean or NULL), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP
    native types will be converted to variants using the same rules as found
    in the constructor for the VARIANT class. COM and DOTNET objects will have
    the value of their default property taken and used as the variant value.

    The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
    functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions,
    consult the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly
    differently; for example |variant_add| in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in
    the MSDN documentation.

                        Variant Integer Division Rules
                    If                                     Then
Both expressions are of the string, date,   Division and integer is returned
character, boolean type
One expression is a string type and the     Division
other a character
One expression is numeric and the other is  Division
a string
Both expressions are numeric                Division
Either expression is NULL                   NULL is returned
Both expressions are empty                  A com_exception with code
                                            DISP_E_DIVBYZERO is thrown
