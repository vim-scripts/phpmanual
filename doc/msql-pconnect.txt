msql_pconnect

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

msql_pconnect â€” Open persistent mSQL connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource msql_pconnect ([ string $hostname ] )~

msql_pconnect() acts very much like |msql_connect| with two major differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host. If one is found, an identifier
for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (
|msql_close| will not close links established by this function).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{hostname}

    The hostname can also include a port number. e.g. hostname,port.

    If not specified, the connection is established by the means of a Unix
    domain socket, being more efficient than a localhost TCP socket
    connection.

        Note: While this function will accept a colon (:) as a host/port
        separator, a comma (,) is the preferred method.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a positive mSQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
