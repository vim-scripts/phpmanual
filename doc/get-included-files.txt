get_included_files

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

get_included_files â€” Returns an array with the names of included or required
files

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array get_included_files ( void )~

Gets the names of all files that have been included using |include|, 
|include_once|, |require| or |require_once|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an array of the names of all files.

The script originally called is considered an "included file," so it will be
listed together with the files referenced by |include| and family.

Files that are included or required multiple times only show up once in the
returned array.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 get_included_files() example

<?php >
    // This file is abc.php

    include 'test1.php';
    include_once 'test2.php';
    require 'test3.php';
    require_once 'test4.php';

    $included_files = get_included_files();

    foreach ($included_files as $filename) {
        echo "$filename\n";
    }

<?>

The above example will output:

abc.php
test1.php
test2.php
test3.php
test4.php

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Files included using the auto_prepend_file configuration directive are not
    included in the returned array.
