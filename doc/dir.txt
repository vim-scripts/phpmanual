dir

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

dir â€” Return an instance of the Directory class

==============================================================================
*Description*

    Directory dir ( string $directory [, resource $context ] )~

A pseudo-object oriented mechanism for reading a directory. The given
{directory} is opened.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{directory}

    Directory to open

{context}

        Note: Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of
        contexts, refer to Streams.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an instance of Directory, or NULL with wrong parameters, or FALSE in
case of another error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 dir() example

Please note the fashion in which Directory::read()'s return value is checked
in the example below. We are explicitly testing whether the return value is
identical to (equal to and of the same type as - see Comparison Operators for
more information) FALSE since otherwise, any directory entry whose name
evaluates to FALSE will stop the loop.

<?php >
    $d = dir("/etc/php5");
    echo "Handle: " . $d->handle . "\n";
    echo "Path: " . $d->path . "\n";
    while (false !== ($entry = $d->read())) {
       echo $entry."\n";
    }
    $d->close();
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Handle: Resource id #2
Path: /etc/php5
.
..
apache
cgi
cli

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    The order in which directory entries are returned by the read method is
    system-dependent.
