fann_create_sparse_array

(PECL fann >= 1.0.0)

fann_create_sparse_array â€” Creates a standard backpropagation neural network,
which is not fully connected using an array of layer sizes

==============================================================================
*Description*

    ReturnType fann_create_sparse_array ( float $connection_rate , int~
    $num_layers , array $layers )~

Creates a standard backpropagation neural network, which is not fully
connected using an array of layer sizes.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection_rate}

    The connection rate controls how many connections there will be in the
    network. If the connection rate is set to 1, the network will be fully
    connected, but if it is set to 0.5 only half of the connections will be
    set. A connection rate of 1 will yield the same result as 
    |fann_create_standard|.

{num_layers}

    The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

{layers}

    An array of layer sizes.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a neural network resource on success, or FALSE on error.
