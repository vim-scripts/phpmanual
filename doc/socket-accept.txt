socket_accept

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5)

socket_accept â€” Accepts a connection on a socket

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource socket_accept ( resource $socket )~

After the socket {socket} has been created using |socket_create|, bound to a
name with |socket_bind|, and told to listen for connections with 
|socket_listen|, this function will accept incoming connections on that socket.
Once a successful connection is made, a new socket resource is returned, which
may be used for communication. If there are multiple connections queued on the
socket, the first will be used. If there are no pending connections, 
socket_accept() will block until a connection becomes present. If {socket} has
been made non-blocking using |socket_set_blocking| or |socket_set_nonblock|,
FALSE will be returned.

The socket resource returned by socket_accept() may not be used to accept new
connections. The original listening socket {socket}, however, remains open and
may be reused.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{socket}

    A valid socket resource created with |socket_create|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a new socket resource on success, or FALSE on error. The actual error
code can be retrieved by calling |socket_last_error|. This error code may be
passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual explanation of the error.
