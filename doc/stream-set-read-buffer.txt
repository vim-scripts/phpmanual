stream_set_read_buffer

(PHP 5 >= 5.3.3)

stream_set_read_buffer â€” Set read file buffering on the given stream

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int stream_set_read_buffer ( resource $stream , int $buffer )~

Sets the read buffer. It's the equivalent of |stream_set_write_buffer|, but
for read operations.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{stream}

    The file pointer.

{buffer}

    The number of bytes to buffer. If {buffer} is 0 then read operations are
    unbuffered. This ensures that all reads with |fread| are completed before
    other processes are allowed to read from that input stream.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request cannot be honored.
