ssh2_connect — Connect to an SSH server

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource ssh2_connect ( string $host [, int $port = 22 [, array $methods~
    [, array $callbacks ]]] )~

Establish a connection to a remote SSH server.

Once connected, the client should verify the server's hostkey using 
|ssh2_fingerprint|, then authenticate using either password or public key.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{host}

{port}

{methods}

    {methods} may be an associative array with up to four parameters as
    described below.

    {methods} may be an associative array with any or all of the following
                                 parameters.

    * - Supported Values are dependent on methods supported by underlying
    library. See » libssh2 documentation for additional information.

    {client_to_server} and {server_to_client} may be an associative array
                 with any or all of the following parameters.

        Note: Crypt and MAC method "none"

        For security reasons, none is disabled by the underlying » libssh2
        library unless explicitly enabled during build time by using the
        appropriate ./configure options. See documentation for the underlying
        library for more information.

    {callbacks} may be an associative array with any or all of the following
    parameters.

               mismatch will be ignored, otherwise the
               connection will be terminated.

*Return* *Values*

Returns a resource on success, or FALSE on error.

*Examples*

Example #1 ssh2_connect() example

Open a connection forcing 3des-cbc when sending packets, any strength aes
cipher when receiving packets, no compression in either direction, and Group1
key exchange.

<?php >
    /* Notify the user if the server terminates the connection */
    function my_ssh_disconnect($reason, $message, $language) {
      printf("Server disconnected with reason code [%d] and message: %s\n",
             $reason, $message);
    }

    $methods = array(
      'kex' => 'diffie-hellman-group1-sha1',
      'client_to_server' => array(
        'crypt' => '3des-cbc',
        'comp' => 'none'),
      'server_to_client' => array(
        'crypt' => 'aes256-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes128-cbc',
        'comp' => 'none'));

    $callbacks = array('disconnect' => 'my_ssh_disconnect');

    $connection = ssh2_connect('shell.example.com', 22, $methods, $callbacks);
    if (!$connection) die('Connection failed');
