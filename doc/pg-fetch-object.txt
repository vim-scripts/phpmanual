pg_fetch_object

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

pg_fetch_object â€” Fetch a row as an object

==============================================================================
*Description*

    object pg_fetch_object ( resource $result [, int $row [, int $result_type~
    = PGSQL_ASSOC ]] )~
    object pg_fetch_object ( resource $result [, int $row [, string~
    $class_name [, array $params ]]] )~

pg_fetch_object() returns an object with properties that correspond to the
fetched row's field names. It can optionally instantiate an object of a
specific class, and pass parameters to that class's constructor.

    Note: This function sets NULL fields to the PHP NULL value.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |pg_fetch_array|, and almost as fast
as |pg_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{result}

    PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|, |pg_query_params
    | or |pg_execute| (among others).

{row}

    Row number in result to fetch. Rows are numbered from 0 upwards. If
    omitted or NULL, the next row is fetched.

{result_type}

    Ignored and deprecated.

{class_name}

    The name of the class to instantiate, set the properties of and return. If
    not specified, a stdClass object is returned.

{params}

    An optional array of parameters to pass to the constructor for
    {class_name} objects.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

An object with one attribute for each field name in the result. Database NULL
values are returned as NULL.

FALSE is returned if {row} exceeds the number of rows in the set, there are no
more rows, or on any other error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 pg_fetch_object() example

<?php  >

    $database = "store";

    $db_conn = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=$database");
    if (!$db_conn) {
      echo "Failed connecting to postgres database $database\n";
      exit;
    }

    $qu = pg_query($db_conn, "SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY author");


    while ($data = pg_fetch_object($qu)) {
      echo $data->author . " (";
      echo $data->year . "): ";
      echo $data->title . "<br />";
    }

    pg_free_result($qu);
    pg_close($db_conn);

<?>
