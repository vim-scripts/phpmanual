ncurses_noraw â€” Switch terminal out of raw mode

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool ncurses_noraw ( void )~
Warning

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Switches the terminal out of raw mode. Raw mode is similar to cbreak mode, in
that characters typed are immediately passed through to the user program. The
differences that are that in raw mode, the interrupt, quit, suspend and flow
control characters are all passed through uninterpreted, instead of generating
a signal.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE if any error occurred, otherwise FALSE.
