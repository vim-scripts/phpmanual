sybase_connect

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

sybase_connect â€” Opens a Sybase server connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource sybase_connect ([ string $servername [, string $username [,~
    string $password [, string $charset [, string $appname [, bool $new =~
    false ]]]]]] )~

sybase_connect() establishes a connection to a Sybase server.

In case a second call is made to sybase_connect() with the same arguments, no
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |sybase_close|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{servername}

    The servername argument has to be a valid servername that is defined in
    the 'interfaces' file.

{username}

    Sybase user name

{password}

    Password associated with {username}.

{charset}

    Specifies the charset for the connection

{appname}

    Specifies an appname for the Sybase connection. This allow you to make
    separate connections in the same script to the same database. This may
    come handy when you have started a transaction in your current connection,
    and you need to be able to do a separate query which cannot be performed
    inside this transaction.

{new}

    Whether to open a new connection or use the existing one.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a positive Sybase link identifier on success, or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

5.3.0   The {new} parameter was added.

==============================================================================
*Examples*
