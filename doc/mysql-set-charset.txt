This extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0, and will be removed in the
future. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also
MySQL: choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information.
Alternatives to this function include:

  * mysqli_set_charset()
  * PDO: Add charset to the connection string, such as charset=utf8

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool mysql_set_charset ( string $charset [, resource $link_identifier =~
    NULL ] )~

Sets the default character set for the current connection.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{charset}

    A valid character set name.

{ link_identifier}

    The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not specified, the last
    link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link is found, it
    will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no arguments.
    If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error is
    generated.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    This function requires MySQL 5.0.7 or later.

    Note:

    This is the preferred way to change the charset. Using |mysql_query| to
    set it (such as SET NAMES utf8) is not recommended. See the MySQL
    character set concepts section for more information.
