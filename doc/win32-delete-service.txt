win32_delete_service â€” Deletes a service entry from the SCM database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed win32_delete_service ( string $servicename [, string $machine ] )~

Attempts to delete a service from the SCM database. Administrative privileges
are required for this to succeed.

This function really just marks the service for deletion. If other processes
(such as the Services Applet) are open, then the deletion will be deferred
until those applications are closed. If a service is marked for deletion,
further attempts to delete it will fail, and attempts to create a new service
with that name will also fail.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{servicename}

    The short name of the service.

{machine}

    The optional machine name. If omitted, the local machine will be used.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns WIN32_NO_ERROR on success, FALSE if there is a problem with the
parameters or a Win32 Error Code on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 A win32_delete_service() example

Deletes the dummyphp service.

<?php >
    win32_delete_service('dummyphp');
<?>
