php_ini_scanned_files

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5)

php_ini_scanned_files â€” Return a list of .ini files parsed from the additional
ini dir

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string php_ini_scanned_files ( void )~

php_ini_scanned_files() returns a comma-separated list of configuration files
parsed after php.ini. These files are found in a directory defined by the
--with-config-file-scan-dir option which is set during compilation.

The returned configuration files also include the path as declared in the
--with-config-file-scan-dir option.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a comma-separated string of .ini files on success. Each comma is
followed by a newline. If the directive --with-config-file-scan-dir wasn't
set, FALSE is returned. If it was set and the directory was empty, an empty
string is returned. If a file is unrecognizable, the file will still make it
into the returned string but a PHP error will also result. This PHP error will
be seen both at compile time and while using php_ini_scanned_files().

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 A simple example to list the returned ini files

<?php >
    if ($filelist = php_ini_scanned_files()) {
        if (strlen($filelist) > 0) {
            $files = explode(',', $filelist);

            foreach ($files as $file) {
                echo "<li>" . trim($file) . "</li>\n";
            }
        }
    }
<?>
