fann_train_on_file

(PECL fann >= 1.0.0)

fann_train_on_file â€” Trains on an entire dataset, which is read from file, for
a period of time

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool fann_train_on_file ( resource $ann , string $filename , int~
    $max_epochs , int $epochs_between_reports , float $desired_error )~

Trains on an entire dataset, which is read from file, for a period of time.

This training uses the training algorithm chosen by 
|fann_set_training_algorithm| and the parameters set for these training
algorithms.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{ann}

    Neural network resource.

{filename}

    The file containing train data

{max_epochs}

    The maximum number of epochs the training should continue

{epochs_between_reports}

    The number of epochs between calling a user function. A value of zero
    means that user function is not called.

{desired_error}

    The desired |fann_get_MSE| or |fann_get_bit_fail|, depending on the stop
    function chosen by |fann_set_train_stop_function|

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
