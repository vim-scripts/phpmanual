(PHP 4, PHP 5)

msql_close â€” Close mSQL connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool msql_close ([ resource $link_identifier ] )~

msql_close() closes the non-persistent connection to the mSQL server that's
associated with the specified link identifier.

Using msql_close() isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution. See also freeing
resources.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{ link_identifier}

    The mSQL connection. If not specified, the last link opened by 
    |msql_connect| is assumed. If no such link is found, the function will try
    to establish a link as if |msql_connect| was called, and use it.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
