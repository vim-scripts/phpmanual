aggregate_methods_by_regexp â€” Selective class methods aggregation to an object
using a regular expression

==============================================================================
*Description*

    void aggregate_methods_by_regexp ( object $object , string $class_name ,~
    string $regexp [, bool $exclude = false ] )~

Aggregates methods from a class to an existing object using a regular
expression to match method names.

The class constructor or methods whose names start with an underscore
character (_), which are considered private to the aggregated class, are
always excluded.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{object}

{class_name}

{regexp}

{exclude}

    The optional parameter {exclude} is used to decide whether the regular
    expression will select the names of methods to include in the aggregation
    (i.e. {exclude} is FALSE), or to exclude from the aggregation ({exclude}
    is TRUE).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

No value is returned.
