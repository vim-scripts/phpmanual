file_exists

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

file_exists â€” Checks whether a file or directory exists

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool file_exists ( string $filename )~

Checks whether a file or directory exists.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    Path to the file or directory.

    On windows, use //computername/share/filename or \\computername\share\
    filename to check files on network shares.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE if the file or directory specified by {filename} exists; FALSE
otherwise.

    Note:

    This function will return FALSE for symlinks pointing to non-existing
    files.

Warning

This function returns FALSE for files inaccessible due to safe mode
restrictions. However these files still can be |included| if they are located
in safe_mode_include_dir.

    Note:

    The check is done using the real UID/GID instead of the effective one.

    Note: Because PHP's integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit
    integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for
    files which are larger than 2GB.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Testing whether a file exists

<?php >
    $filename = '/path/to/foo.txt';

    if (file_exists($filename)) {
        echo "The file $filename exists";
    } else {
        echo "The file $filename does not exist";
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note: The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for
    more details.

Tip

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to Supported Protocols and Wrappers to determine which wrappers support |stat|
family of functionality.
