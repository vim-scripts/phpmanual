svn_cleanup — Recursively cleanup a working copy directory, finishing
incomplete operations and removing locks

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool svn_cleanup ( string $workingdir )~

Recursively cleanup working copy directory {workingdir}, finishing any
incomplete operations and removing working copy locks. Use when a working copy
is in limbo and needs to be usable again.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{workingdir}

    String path to local working directory to cleanup

        Note: Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working
        directory was the one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling
        script's working directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

Warning

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Basic example

This example demonstrates clean up of a working copy in a directory named
help-me:

<?php >
    svn_cleanup(realpath('help-me'));
<?>

The |realpath| call is necessary due to SVN's quirky handling of relative
paths.
