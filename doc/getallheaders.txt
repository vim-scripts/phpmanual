*Changelog*

Version                              Description
5.5.7   This function became available in the CLI server.
5.4.0   This function became available under FastCGI. Previously, it was
        supported only when PHP was installed as an Apache module.
        As of PHP 4.3.3 you can use this function with the NSAPI server module
4.3.3   in Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.

4.3.0   Became an alias for |apache_request_headers|. Essentially, it was
        renamed. This is because this function only works with Apache.
