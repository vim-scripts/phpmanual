system

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

system â€” Execute an external program and display the output

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string system ( string $command [, int &$return_var ] )~

system() is just like the C version of the function in that it executes the
given {command} and outputs the result.

The system() call also tries to automatically flush the web server's output
buffer after each line of output if PHP is running as a server module.

If you need to execute a command and have all the data from the command passed
directly back without any interference, use the |passthru| function.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{command}

    The command that will be executed.

{return_var}

    If the {return_var} argument is present, then the return status of the
    executed command will be written to this variable.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the last line of the command output on success, and FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 system() example

<?php >
    echo '<pre>';

    // Outputs all the result of shellcommand "ls", and returns
    // the last output line into $last_line. Stores the return value
    // of the shell command in $retval.
    $last_line = system('ls', $retval);

    // Printing additional info
    echo '
    </pre>
    <hr />Last line of the output: ' . $last_line . '
    <hr />Return value: ' . $retval;
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

Warning

When allowing user-supplied data to be passed to this function, use 
|escapeshellarg| or |escapeshellcmd| to ensure that users cannot trick the
system into executing arbitrary commands.

    Note:

    If a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue
    running in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to
    a file or another output stream. Failing to do so will cause PHP to hang
    until the execution of the program ends.

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, you can only execute files within the
    safe_mode_exec_dir. For practical reasons, it is currently not allowed to
    have .. components in the path to the executable.

Warning

With safe mode enabled, the command string is escaped with |escapeshellcmd|.
Thus, echo y | echo x becomes echo y \| echo x.
