mysql_pconnect

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

mysql_pconnect â€” Open a persistent connection to a MySQL server

Warning

This extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0, and will be removed in the
future. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also
MySQL: choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information.
Alternatives to this function include:

  * |mysqli_connect| with p: host prefix
  * PDO::__construct() with PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT as a driver option

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource mysql_pconnect ([ string $server =~
    ini_get("mysql.default_host") [, string $username =~
    ini_get("mysql.default_user") [, string $password =~
    ini_get("mysql.default_password") [, int $client_flags = 0 ]]]]~
)~

Establishes a persistent connection to a MySQL server.

mysql_pconnect() acts very much like |mysql_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (
|mysql_close| will not close links established by mysql_pconnect()).

This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{server}

    The MySQL server. It can also include a port number. e.g. "hostname:port"
    or a path to a local socket e.g. ":/path/to/socket" for the localhost.

    If the PHP directive mysql.default_host is undefined (default), then the
    default value is 'localhost:3306'

{username}

    The username. Default value is the name of the user that owns the server
    process.

{password}

    The password. Default value is an empty password.

{client_flags}

    The {client_flags} parameter can be a combination of the following
    constants: 128 (enable LOAD DATA LOCAL handling), MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL,
    MYSQL_CLIENT_COMPRESS, MYSQL_CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE or
    MYSQL_CLIENT_INTERACTIVE.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a MySQL persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                    Description
5.5.0   This function will generate an E_DEPRECATED error.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Note, that these kind of links only work if you are using a module version
    of PHP. See the Persistent Database Connections section for more
    information.

Warning

Using persistent connections can require a bit of tuning of your Apache and
MySQL configurations to ensure that you do not exceed the number of
connections allowed by MySQL.

    Note:

    You can suppress the error message on failure by prepending a @ to the
    function name.
