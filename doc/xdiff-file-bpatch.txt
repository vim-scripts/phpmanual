    bool xdiff_file_bpatch ( string $file , string $patch , string $dest )~

Patches a {file} with a binary {patch} and stores the result in a file {dest}.
This function accepts patches created both via |xdiff_file_bdiff| and 
|xdiff_file_rabdiff| functions or their string counterparts.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{file}

    The original file.

{patch}

    The binary patch file.

{dest}

    Path of the resulting file.

Example #1 xdiff_file_bpatch() example

The following code applies binary diff to a file.

<?php >
    $old_version = 'archive-1.0.tgz';
    $patch = 'archive.bpatch';

    $result = xdiff_file_bpatch($old_version, $patch, 'archive-1.1.tgz');
    if ($result) {
       echo "File patched";
    } else {
       echo "File couldn't be patched";
    }

    Both files ({file} and {patch}) will be loaded into memory so ensure that
    your memory_limit is set high enough.
