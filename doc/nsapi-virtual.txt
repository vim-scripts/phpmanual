nsapi_virtual

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.3, PHP 5)

nsapi_virtual â€” Perform an NSAPI sub-request

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool nsapi_virtual ( string $uri )~

nsapi_virtual() is an NSAPI-specific function which is equivalent to <!--#
include virtual...--> in SSI (.shtml files). It does an NSAPI sub-request. It
is useful for including CGI scripts or .shtml files, or anything else that
you'd parse through webserver.

To run the sub-request, all buffers are terminated and flushed to the browser,
pending headers are sent too.

You cannot make recursive requests with this function to other PHP scripts. If
you want to include PHP scripts, use |include| or |require|.

    Note:

    This function depends on a undocumented feature of the Netscape/iPlanet/
    Sun webservers. Use |phpinfo| to determine if it is available. In the Unix
    environment it should always work, in Windows it depends on the name of a
    ns-httpdXX.dll file.

    Read the note about subrequests in the NSAPI section (UNIX, Windows) if
    you experience this problem.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{uri}

    The URI of the script.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
