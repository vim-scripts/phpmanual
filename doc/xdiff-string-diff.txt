xdiff_string_diff â€” Make unified diff of two strings

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string xdiff_string_diff ( string $old_data , string $new_data [, int~
    $context = 3 [, bool $minimal = false ]] )~

Makes an unified diff containing differences between {old_data} string and
{new_data} string and returns it. The resulting diff is human-readable. An
optional {context} parameter specifies how many lines of context should be
added around each change. Setting {minimal} parameter to true will result in
outputting the shortest patch file possible (can take a long time).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{old_data}

    First string with data. It acts as "old" data.

{new_data}

    Second string with data. It acts as "new" data.

{context}

    Indicates how many lines of context you want to include in the diff
    result.

{minimal}

    Set this parameter to TRUE if you want to minimalize the size of the
    result (can take a long time).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns string with resulting diff or FALSE if an internal error happened.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 xdiff_string_diff() example

The following code makes unified diff of two articles.

<?php >
    $old_article = file_get_contents('./old_article.txt');
    $new_article = $_REQUEST['article']; /
    * Let's say that someone pasted a new article to html form */

    $diff = xdiff_string_diff($old_article, $new_article, 1);
    if (is_string($diff)) {
        echo "Differences between two articles:\n";
        echo $diff;
    }

<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    This function doesn't work well with binary strings. To make diff of
    binary strings use |xdiff_string_bdiff|/|xdiff_string_rabdiff|.
