==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool ps_setmiterlimit ( resource $psdoc , float $value )~

If two lines join in a small angle and the line join is set to
PS_LINEJOIN_MITER, then the resulting spike will be very long. The miter limit
is the maximum ratio of the miter length (the length of the spike) and the
line width.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{psdoc}

    Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{value}

    The maximum ratio between the miter length and the line width. Larger
    values (> 10) will result in very long spikes when two lines meet in a
    small angle. Keep the default unless you know what you are doing.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
