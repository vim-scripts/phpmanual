wincache_ocache_fileinfo

(PECL wincache >= 1.0.0)

wincache_ocache_fileinfo â€” Retrieves information about files cached in the
opcode cache

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array wincache_ocache_fileinfo ([ bool $summaryonly = false ] )~

Retrieves information about opcode cache content and its usage.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{summaryonly}

    Controls whether the returned array will contain information about
    individual cache entries along with the opcode cache summary.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Array of meta data about opcode cache or FALSE on failure

The array returned by this function contains the following elements:

  * total_cache_uptime - total time in seconds that the opcode cache has been
    active
  * total_file_count - total number of files that are currently in the opcode
    cache
  * total_hit_count - number of times the compiled opcode have been served
    from the cache
  * total_miss_count - number of times the compiled opcode have not been found
    in the cache
  * is_local_cache - true is the cache metadata is for a local cache instance,
    false if the metadata is for the global cache
  * file_entries - an array that contains the information about all the cached
    files:
      + file_name - absolute file name of the cached file
      + add_time - time in seconds since the file has been added to the opcode
        cache
      + use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the
        opcode cache
      + last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for
        modifications
      + hit_count - number of times the file has been served from the cache
      + function_count - number of functions in the cached file
      + class_count - number of classes in the cached file

*Examples*

Example #1 A wincache_ocache_fileinfo() example

<pre>
<?php >
    print_r(wincache_ocache_fileinfo());
<?>
</pre>

The above example will output:

Array
(
    [total_cache_uptime] => 17357
    [total_file_count] => 121
    [total_hit_count] => 36562
    [total_miss_count] => 201
    [file_entries] => Array
        (
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [file_name] => c:\inetpub\wwwroot\checkcache.php
                    [add_time] => 17356
                    [use_time] => 7
                    [last_check] => 10
                    [hit_count] => 454
                    [function_count] => 0
                    [class_count] => 1
                )
            [2] => Array (...iterates for each cached file)
        )
)
