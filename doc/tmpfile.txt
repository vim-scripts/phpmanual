tmpfile

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

tmpfile â€” Creates a temporary file

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource tmpfile ( void )~

Creates a temporary file with a unique name in read-write (w+) mode and
returns a file handle .

The file is automatically removed when closed (for example, by calling |fclose
|, or when there are no remaining references to the file handle returned by 
tmpfile()), or when the script ends.

For details, consult your system documentation on the tmpfile(3) function, as
well as the stdio.h header file.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a file handle, similar to the one returned by |fopen|, for the new
file or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 tmpfile() example

<?php >
    $temp = tmpfile();
    fwrite($temp, "writing to tempfile");
    fseek($temp, 0);
    echo fread($temp, 1024);
    fclose($temp); // this removes the file
<?>

The above example will output:

writing to tempfile
