xdiff_file_diff â€” Make unified diff of two files

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool xdiff_file_diff ( string $old_file , string $new_file , string $dest~
    [, int $context = 3 [, bool $minimal = false ]] )~

Makes an unified diff containing differences between {old_file} and {new_file}
and stores it in {dest} file. The resulting file is human-readable. An
optional {context} parameter specifies how many lines of context should be
added around each change. Setting {minimal} parameter to true will result in
outputting the shortest patch file possible (can take a long time).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{old_file}

    Path to the first file. This file acts as "old" file.

{new_file}

    Path to the second file. This file acts as "new" file.

{dest}

    Path of the resulting patch file.

{context}

    Indicates how many lines of context you want to include in diff result.

{minimal}

    Set this parameter to TRUE if you want to minimalize size of the result
    (can take a long time).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 xdiff_file_diff() example

The following code makes unified diff of two php files with context length of
2.

<?php >
    $old_version = 'my_script.php';
    $new_version = 'my_new_script.php';

    xdiff_file_diff($old_version, $new_version, 'my_script.diff', 2);
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    This function doesn't work well with binary files. To make diff of binary
    files use |xdiff_file_bdiff|/|xdiff_file_rabdiff| function.
