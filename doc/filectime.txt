filectime

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

filectime â€” Gets inode change time of file

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int filectime ( string $filename )~

Gets the inode change time of a file.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    Path to the file.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the time the file was last changed, or FALSE on failure. The time is
returned as a Unix timestamp.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 A filectime() example

<?php >

    // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last changed: December 29 2002 22:16:23.

    $filename = 'somefile.txt';
    if (file_exists($filename)) {
        echo "$filename was last changed: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", filectime(
    $filename));
    }

<?>

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Note: In most Unix filesystems, a file is considered changed when its
    inode data is changed; that is, when the permissions, owner, group, or
    other metadata from the inode is updated. See also |filemtime| (which is
    what you want to use when you want to create "Last Modified" footers on
    web pages) and |fileatime|.

    Note:

    Note also that in some Unix texts the ctime of a file is referred to as
    being the creation time of the file. This is wrong. There is no creation
    time for Unix files in most Unix filesystems.

    Note:

    Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.

    Note: The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for
    more details.

Tip

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to Supported Protocols and Wrappers to determine which wrappers support |stat|
family of functionality.
