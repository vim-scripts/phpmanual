ftell

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

ftell â€” Returns the current position of the file read/write pointer

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int ftell ( resource $handle )~

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{handle}

    The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
    opened by |fopen| or |popen|. ftell() gives undefined results for
    append-only streams (opened with "a" flag).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle} as an integer;
i.e., its offset into the file stream.

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.

    Note: Because PHP's integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit
    integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for
    files which are larger than 2GB.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 ftell() example

<?php >

    // opens a file and read some data
    $fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
    $data = fgets($fp, 12);

    // where are we ?
    echo ftell($fp); // 11

    fclose($fp);

<?>
