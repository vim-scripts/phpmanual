fpassthru

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

fpassthru â€” Output all remaining data on a file pointer

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int fpassthru ( resource $handle )~

Reads to EOF on the given file pointer from the current position and writes
the results to the output buffer.

You may need to call |rewind| to reset the file pointer to the beginning of
the file if you have already written data to the file.

If you just want to dump the contents of a file to the output buffer, without
first modifying it or seeking to a particular offset, you may want to use the 
|readfile|, which saves you the |fopen| call.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{handle}

    The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
    opened by |fopen| or |fsockopen| (and not yet closed by |fclose|).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

If an error occurs, fpassthru() returns FALSE. Otherwise, fpassthru() returns
the number of characters read from {handle} and passed through to the output.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Using fpassthru() with binary files

<?php >

    // open the file in a binary mode
    $name = './img/ok.png';
    $fp = fopen($name, 'rb');

    // send the right headers
    header("Content-Type: image/png");
    header("Content-Length: " . filesize($name));

    // dump the picture and stop the script
    fpassthru($fp);
    exit;

<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    When using fpassthru() on a binary file on Windows systems, you should
    make sure to open the file in binary mode by appending a b to the mode
    used in the call to |fopen|.

    You are encouraged to use the b flag when dealing with binary files, even
    if your system does not require it, so that your scripts will be more
    portable.
