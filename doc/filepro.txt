filepro â€” Read and verify the map file

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool filepro ( string $directory )~

This reads and verifies the map file, storing the field count and info.

No locking is done, so you should avoid modifying your filePro database while
it may be opened in PHP.

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or
    directories being operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script
    that is being executed.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{directory}

    The map directory.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
