ifx_pconnect

(PHP 4, PHP <=5.2.0)

ifx_pconnect â€” Open persistent Informix connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource ifx_pconnect ([ string $database [, string $userid [, string~
    $password ]]] )~

ifx_pconnect() acts very much like |ifx_connect| with two major differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (
|ifx_close| will not close links established by ifx_pconnect()).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

All of the arguments are optional, and if they're missing, defaults are taken
from values supplied in php.ini (ifx.default_host for the host (Informix
libraries will use INFORMIXSERVER environment value if not defined),
ifx.default_user for user, ifx.default_password for the password (none if not
defined).

{database}

    The database name, as a string.

{userid}

    The username, as a string.

{password}

    The password, as a string.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns: valid Informix persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
errors.
