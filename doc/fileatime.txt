fileatime

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

fileatime â€” Gets last access time of file

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int fileatime ( string $filename )~

Gets the last access time of the given file.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    Path to the file.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the time the file was last accessed, or FALSE on failure. The time is
returned as a Unix timestamp.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 fileatime() example

<?php >

    // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last accessed: December 29 2002 22:16:23.

    $filename = 'somefile.txt';
    if (file_exists($filename)) {
        echo "$filename was last accessed: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", fileatime(
    $filename));
    }

<?>

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    The atime of a file is supposed to change whenever the data blocks of a
    file are being read. This can be costly performance-wise when an
    application regularly accesses a very large number of files or
    directories.

    Some Unix filesystems can be mounted with atime updates disabled to
    increase the performance of such applications; USENET news spools are a
    common example. On such filesystems this function will be useless.

    Note:

    Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.

    Note: The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for
    more details.

Tip

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to Supported Protocols and Wrappers to determine which wrappers support |stat|
family of functionality.
