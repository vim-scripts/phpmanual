*Parameters*

{pxdoc}

    Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{num}

    The record number is an artificial number counting records in the order as

{mode}

    The optional {mode} can be PX_KEYTOLOWER or PX_KEYTOUPPER in order to
    convert the keys of the returned array into lower or upper case. If {mode}
    is not passed or is 0, then the key will be exactly like the field name.
    The element values will contain the field values. NULL values will be
    retained and are different from 0.0, 0 or the empty string. Fields of type
    PX_FIELD_TIME will be returned as an integer counting the number of
    milliseconds starting at midnight. A timestamp (PX_FIELD_TIMESTAMP) and
    date (PX_FIELD_DATE) are floating point respectively int values counting
    milliseconds respectively days starting at the beginning of julian
    calendar. Use the functions |px-timestamp2string| and |px-date2string| to
    convert them into a character representation.
