phpinfo

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

phpinfo — Outputs information about PHP's configuration

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool phpinfo ([ int $what = INFO_ALL ] )~

Outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP. This
includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions, the PHP
version, server information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP
environment, OS version information, paths, master and local values of
configuration options, HTTP headers, and the PHP License.

Because every system is setup differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check
configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given
system.

phpinfo() is also a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS
(Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) data.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{what}

    The output may be customized by passing one or more of the following
    constants bitwise values summed together in the optional {what} parameter.
    One can also combine the respective constants or bitwise values together
    with the or operator.

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        Logo GUIDs were replaced with data URIs, and so turning off expose_php
5.5.0   now has no effect on the result of phpinfo(). Credits are also now
        embedded within the output itself instead of linked.
5.2.2   The "Loaded Configuration File" information was added, when before
        only "Configuration File (php.ini) Path" existed.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 phpinfo() Example

<?php >

    // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
    phpinfo();

    // Show just the module information.
    // phpinfo(8) yields identical results.
    phpinfo(INFO_MODULES);

<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    In versions of PHP before 5.5, parts of the information displayed are
    disabled when the expose_php configuration setting is set to off. This
    includes the PHP and Zend logos, and the credits.

    Note:

    phpinfo() outputs plain text instead of HTML when using the CLI mode.
