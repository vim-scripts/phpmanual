dbx_fetch_row

(PHP 5 <= 5.0.5, PECL dbx >= 1.1.0)

dbx_fetch_row â€” Fetches rows from a query-result that had the
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED flag set

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed dbx_fetch_row ( object $result_identifier )~

dbx_fetch_row() fetches rows from a result identifier that had the
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED flag set.

When the DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED is not set in the query, dbx_fetch_row() will
fail as all rows have already been fetched into the results data property.

As a side effect, the rows property of the query-result object is incremented
for each successful call to dbx_fetch_row().

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{result_identifier}

    A result set returned by |dbx_query|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an object on success that contains the same information as any row
would have in the |dbx_query| result data property, including columns
accessible by index or fieldname when the flags for |dbx_query| were set that
way.

Upon failure, returns 0 (e.g. when no more rows are available).

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 How to handle the returned value

<?php >
    $result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id, parentid, description FROM table', 
    DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED);

    echo "<table>\n";
    while ($row = dbx_fetch_row($result)) {
        echo "<tr>\n";
        foreach ($row as $field) {
            echo "<td>$field</td>";
        }
        echo "</tr>\n";
    }
    echo "</table>\n";
<?>
