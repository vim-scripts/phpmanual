mb_send_mail

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.6, PHP 5)

mb_send_mail — Send encoded mail

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool mb_send_mail ( string $to , string $subject , string $message [,~
    string $additional_headers = NULL [, string $additional_parameter = NULL~
    ]] )~

Sends email. Headers and messages are converted and encoded according to the 
|mb_language| setting. It's a wrapper function for |mail|, so see also |mail|
for details.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{to}

    The mail addresses being sent to. Multiple recipients may be specified by
    putting a comma between each address in {to}. This parameter is not
    automatically encoded.

{subject}

    The subject of the mail.

{message}

    The message of the mail.

{additional_headers} (optional)

    String to be inserted at the end of the email header.

    This is typically used to add extra headers (From, Cc, and Bcc). Multiple
    extra headers should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n). Validate parameter
    not to be injected unwanted headers by attackers.

        Note:

        When sending mail, the mail must contain a From header. This can be
        set with the {additional_headers} parameter, or a default can be set
        in php.ini.

        Failing to do this will result in an error message similar to Warning:
        mail(): "sendmail_from" not set in php.ini or custom "From:" header
        missing. The From header sets also Return-Path under Windows.

        Note:

        If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some Unix mail
        transfer agents (most notably » qmail) replace LF by CRLF
        automatically (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This
        should be a last resort, as it does not comply with » RFC 2822.

{additional_parameter}

    {additional_parameter} is a MTA command line parameter. It is useful when
    setting the correct Return-Path header when using sendmail.

    This parameter is escaped by |escapeshellcmd| internally to prevent
    command execution. |escapeshellcmd| prevents command execution, but allows
    to add addtional parameters. For security reason, this parameter should be
    validated.

    Since |escapeshellcmd| is applied automatically, some characters that are
    allowed as email addresses by internet RFCs cannot be used. Programs that
    are required to use these characters |mail| cannot be used.

    The user that the webserver runs as should be added as a trusted user to
    the sendmail configuration to prevent a 'X-Warning' header from being
    added to the message when the envelope sender (-f) is set using this
    method. For sendmail users, this file is /etc/mail/trusted-users.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
