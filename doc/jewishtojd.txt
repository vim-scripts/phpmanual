JewishToJD â€” Converts a date in the Jewish Calendar to Julian Day Count

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int jewishtojd ( int $month , int $day , int $year )~

Although this function can handle dates all the way back to the year 1 (3761
B.C.), such use may not be meaningful. The Jewish calendar has been in use for
several thousand years, but in the early days there was no formula to
determine the start of a month. A new month was started when the new moon was
first observed.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{month}

    The month as a number from 1 to 13

{day}

    The day as a number from 1 to 30

{year}

    The year as a number between 1 and 9999

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

The julian day for the given jewish date as an integer.
