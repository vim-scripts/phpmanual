odbc_fetch_row

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

odbc_fetch_row â€” Fetch a row

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool odbc_fetch_row ( resource $result_id [, int $row_number ] )~

Fetches a row of the data that was returned by |odbc_do| or |odbc_exec|. After
odbc_fetch_row() is called, the fields of that row can be accessed with 
|odbc_result|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{result_id}

    The result identifier.

{row_number}

    If {row_number} is not specified, odbc_fetch_row() will try to fetch the
    next row in the result set. Calls to odbc_fetch_row() with and without
    {row_number} can be mixed.

    To step through the result more than once, you can call odbc_fetch_row()
    with {row_number} 1, and then continue doing odbc_fetch_row() without
    {row_number} to review the result. If a driver doesn't support fetching
    rows by number, the {row_number} parameter is ignored.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE if there was a row, FALSE otherwise.
