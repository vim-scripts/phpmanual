proc_terminate

(PHP 5)

proc_terminate â€” Kills a process opened by proc_open

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool proc_terminate ( resource $process [, int $signal = 15 ] )~

Signals a {process} (created using |proc_open|) that it should terminate. 
proc_terminate() returns immediately and does not wait for the process to
terminate.

proc_terminate() allows you terminate the process and continue with other
tasks. You may poll the process (to see if it has stopped yet) by using the 
|proc_get_status| function.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{process}

    The |proc_open| resource that will be closed.

{signal}

    This optional parameter is only useful on POSIX operating systems; you may
    specify a signal to send to the process using the kill(2) system call. The
    default is SIGTERM.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the termination status of the process that was run.
