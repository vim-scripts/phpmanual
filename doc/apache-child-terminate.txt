apache_child_terminate

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.5, PHP 5)

apache_child_terminate â€” Terminate apache process after this request

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool apache_child_terminate ( void )~

apache_child_terminate() will register the Apache process executing the
current PHP request for termination once execution of PHP code is completed.
It may be used to terminate a process after a script with high memory
consumption has been run as memory will usually only be freed internally but
not given back to the operating system.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE if PHP is running as an Apache 1 module, the Apache version is
non-multithreaded, and the child_terminate PHP directive is enabled (disabled
by default). If these conditions are not met, FALSE is returned and an error
of level E_WARNING is generated.
