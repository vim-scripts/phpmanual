fann_create_shortcut

(PECL fann >= 1.0.0)

fann_create_shortcut â€” Creates a standard backpropagation neural network which
is not fully connectected and has shortcut connections

==============================================================================
*Description*

    reference fann_create_shortcut ( int $num_layers , int $num_neurons1 ,~
    int $num_neurons2 [, int $... ] )~

Creates a standard backpropagation neural network, which is not fully
connected and which also has shortcut connections.

Shortcut connections are connections that skip layers. A fully connected
network with shortcut connections, is a network where all neurons are
connected to all neurons in later layers. Including direct connections from
the input layer to the output layer.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{num_layers}

    The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

{num_neurons1}

    Number of neurons in the first layer.

{num_neurons2}

    Number of neurons in the second layer.

{...}

    Number of neurons in other layers.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a neural network resource on success, or FALSE on error.
