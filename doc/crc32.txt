crc32

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.1, PHP 5)

crc32 â€” Calculates the crc32 polynomial of a string

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int crc32 ( string $str )~

Generates the cyclic redundancy checksum polynomial of 32-bit lengths of the
{str}. This is usually used to validate the integrity of data being
transmitted.

Warning

Because PHP's integer type is signed many crc32 checksums will result in
negative integers on 32bit platforms. On 64bit installations all crc32()
results will be positive integers though.

So you need to use the "%u" formatter of |sprintf| or |printf| to get the
string representation of the unsigned crc32() checksum in decimal format.

For a hexadecimal representation of the checksum you can either use the "%x"
formatter of |sprintf| or |printf| or the |dechex| conversion functions, both
of these also take care of converting the crc32() result to an unsigned
integer.

Having 64bit installations also return negative integers for higher result
values was considered but would break the hexadecimal conversion as negatives
would get an extra 0xFFFFFFFF######## offset then. As hexadecimal
representation seems to be the most common use case we decided to not break
this even if it breaks direct decimal comparisons in about 50% of the cases
when moving from 32 to 64bits.

In retrospect having the function return an integer maybe wasn't the best idea
and returning a hex string representation right away (as e.g. |md5| does)
might have been a better plan to begin with.

For a more portable solution you may also consider the generic |hash|. hash
("crc32b", $str) will return the same string as dechex(crc32($str)).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{str}

    The data.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the crc32 checksum of {str} as an integer.

*Examples*

Example #1 Displaying a crc32 checksum

This example shows how to print a converted checksum with the |printf|
function:

<?php >
    $checksum = crc32("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.");
    printf("%u\n", $checksum);
<?>
