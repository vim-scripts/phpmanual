*Changelog*

Version                              Description
5.3.1   rename() can now rename files across drives in Windows.
        rename() can now also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to
5.0.0   Supported Protocols and Wrappers for a listing of which wrappers
        support rename().
        rename() may now be able to rename files across partitions on *nix
        based systems, provided the appropriate permissions are held. Warnings
4.3.3   may be generated if the destination filesystem doesn't permit chown()
        or chmod() system calls to be made on files — for example, if the
        destination filesystem is a FAT filesystem.
