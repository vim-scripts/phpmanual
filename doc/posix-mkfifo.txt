*Description*

    bool posix_mkfifo ( string $pathname , int $mode )~

posix_mkfifo() creates a special FIFO file which exists in the file system and
acts as a bidirectional communication endpoint for processes.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{pathname}

    Path to the FIFO file.

{mode}

    The second parameter {mode} has to be given in octal notation (e.g. 0644).
    The permission of the newly created FIFO also depends on the setting of
    the current |umask|. The permissions of the created file are (mode &
    ~umask).

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or
    directories being operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script
    that is being executed.
