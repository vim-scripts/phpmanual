(PECL paradox >= 1.0.0)

px_get_info â€” Return lots of information about a paradox file

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array px_get_info ( resource $pxdoc )~

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{pxdoc}

    Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an associated array with lots of information about a paradox file.
This array is likely to be extended in the future.

fileversion

    Version of file multiplied by 10, e.g. 70.

tablename

    Name of table as stored in the file. If the database was created by pxlib,
    then this will be the name of the file without the extension.

numrecords

    Number of records in this table.

numfields

    Number of fields in this table.

headersize

    Number of bytes used for the header. This is usually 0x800.

recordsize

    Number of bytes used for each record. This is the sum of all field sizes
    (available since version 1.4.2).

maxtablesize

    This value multiplied by 0x400 is the size of a data block in bytes. The
    maximum number of records in a datablock is the integer part of
    (maxtablesize * 0x400 - 8) / recordsize.

numdatablocks

    The number of data blocks in the file. Each data block contains a certain
    number of records which depends on the record size and the data block size
    (maxtablesize). Data blocks may not necessarily be completely filled.

numindexfields

    Number of fields used for the primary index. The fields do always start
    with field number 1.

codepage

    The DOS codepage which was used for encoding fields with character data.
    If the target encoding is not set with |px_set_targetencoding| this will
    be the encoding for character fields when records are being accessed with 
    |px_get_record| or |px_retrieve_record|.
