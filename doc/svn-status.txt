svn_status — Returns the status of working copy files and directories

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array svn_status ( string $path [, int $flags = 0 ] )~

Returns the status of working copy files and directories, giving
modifications, additions, deletions and other changes to items in the working
copy.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{path}

    Local path to file or directory to retrieve status of.

        Note: Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working
        directory was the one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling
        script's working directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

{flags}

    Any combination of SVN_NON_RECURSIVE, SVN_ALL (regardless of modification
    status), SVN_SHOW_UPDATES (entries will be added for items that are
    out-of-date), SVN_NO_IGNORE (disregard svn:ignore properties when scanning
    for new files) and SVN_IGNORE_EXTERNALS.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a numerically indexed array of associative arrays detailing the status
of items in the repository:

Array (
    [0] => Array (
        // information on item
    )
    [1] => ...
)

The information on the item is an associative array that can contain the
following keys:

path
    String path to file/directory of this entry on local filesystem.
text_status
    Status of item's text. Refer to status constants for possible values.
repos_text_status
    Status of item's text in repository. Only accurate if {update} was set to
    TRUE. Refer to status constants for possible values.
prop_status
    Status of item's properties. Refer to status constants for possible
    values.
repos_prop_status
    Status of item's property in repository. Only accurate if {update} was set
    to TRUE. Refer to status constants for possible values.
locked
    Whether or not the item is locked. (Only set if TRUE.)
copied
    Whether or not the item was copied (scheduled for addition with history).
    (Only set if TRUE.)
switched
    Whether or not the item was switched using the switch command. (Only set
    if TRUE)

These keys are only set if the item is versioned:

name
    Base name of item in repository.
url
    URL of item in repository.
repos
    Base URL of repository.
revision
    Integer revision of item in working copy.
kind
    Type of item, i.e. file or directory. Refer to type constants for possible
    values.
schedule
    Scheduled action for item, i.e. addition or deletion. Constants for these
    magic numbers are not available, they can be emulated by using:
    <?php >
    if (!defined('svn_wc_schedule_normal')) {
        define('svn_wc_schedule_normal',  0); // nothing special
        define('svn_wc_schedule_add',     1); // item will be added
        define('svn_wc_schedule_delete',  2); // item will be deleted
        define('svn_wc_schedule_replace', 3); //
     item will be added and deleted
    }
<    ?>
deleted
    Whether or not the item was deleted, but parent revision lags behind.
    (Only set if TRUE.)
absent
    Whether or not the item is absent, that is, Subversion knows that there
    should be something there but there isn't. (Only set if TRUE.)
incomplete
    Whether or not the entries file for a directory is incomplete. (Only set
    if TRUE.)
cmt_date
    Integer Unix timestamp of last commit date. (Unaffected by {update}.)
cmt_rev
    Integer revision of last commit. (Unaffected by {update}.)
cmt_author
    String author of last commit. (Unaffected by {update}.)
prop_time
    Integer Unix timestamp of last up-to-date time for properties
text_time
    Integer Unix timestamp of last up-to-date time for text

*Examples*

Example #1 Basic example

This example demonstrates a basic, theoretical usage of this function.

<?php >
    print_r(svn_status(realpath('wc')));
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Array (
    [0] => Array (
        [path] => /home/bob/wc/sandwich.txt
        [text_status] => 8 // item was modified
        [repos_text_status] => 1 // no information available, use update
        [prop_status] => 3 // no changes
        [repos_prop_status] => 1 // no information available, use update
        [name] => sandwich.txt
        [url] => http://www.example.com/svnroot/deli/trunk/sandwich.txt
        [repos] => http://www.example.com/svnroot/
        [revision] => 123
        [kind] => 1 // file
        [schedule] => 0 // no special actions scheduled
        [cmt_date] => 1165543135
        [cmt_rev] => 120
        [cmt_author] => Alice
        [prop_time] => 1180201728
        [text_time] => 1180201729
    )
)
