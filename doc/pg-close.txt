pg_close

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

pg_close â€” Closes a PostgreSQL connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool pg_close ([ resource $connection ] )~

pg_close() closes the non-persistent connection to a PostgreSQL database
associated with the given {connection} resource.

    Note:

    Using pg_close() is not usually necessary, as non-persistent open
    connections are automatically closed at the end of the script.

If there is open large object resource on the connection, do not close the
connection before closing all large object resources.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not present,
    the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
    connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 pg_close() example

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mary")
       or die("Could not connect");
    echo "Connected successfully";
    pg_close($dbconn);
<?>

The above example will output:
