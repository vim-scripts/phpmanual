msql_connect

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

msql_connect â€” Open mSQL connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource msql_connect ([ string $hostname ] )~

msql_connect() establishes a connection to a mSQL server.

If a second call is made to msql_connect() with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |msql_close|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{hostname}

    The hostname can also include a port number. e.g. hostname,port.

    If not specified, the connection is established by the means of a Unix
    domain socket, being then more efficient then a localhost TCP socket
    connection.

        Note:

        While this function will accept a colon (:) as a host/port separator,
        a comma (,) is the preferred method.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a positive mSQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

  * |msql_close| - Close mSQL connection
