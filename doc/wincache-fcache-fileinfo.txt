*Examples*

Example #1 A wincache_fcache_fileinfo() example

<pre>
<?php >
    print_r(wincache_fcache_fileinfo());
<?>
</pre>

The above example will output:

Array
(   [total_cache_uptime] => 3234
    [total_file_count] => 5
    [total_hit_count] => 0
    [total_miss_count] => 1
    [file_entries] => Array
        (
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [file_name] => c:\inetpub\wwwroot\checkcache.php
                    [add_time] => 1
                    [use_time] => 0
                    [last_check] => 1
                    [hit_count] => 1
                    [file_size] => 2435
                )
            [2] => Array (...iterates for each cached file)
        )
)
