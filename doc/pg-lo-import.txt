pg_lo_import

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5)

pg_lo_import â€” Import a large object from file

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int pg_lo_import ([ resource $connection ], string $pathname [, mixed~
    $object_id ] )~

pg_lo_import() creates a new large object in the database using a file on the
filesystem as its data source.

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or
    directories being operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script
    that is being executed.

    Note:

    This function used to be called pg_loimport().

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not present,
    the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
    connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{pathname}

    The full path and file name of the file on the client filesystem from
    which to read the large object data.

{object_id}

    If an {object_id} is given the function will try to create a large object
    with this id, else a free object id is assigned by the server. The
    parameter was added in PHP 5.3 and relies on functionality that first
    appeared in PostgreSQL 8.1.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

The OID of the newly created large object, or FALSE on failure.
