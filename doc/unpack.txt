unpack

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

unpack â€” Unpack data from binary string

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array unpack ( string $format , string $data )~

Unpacks from a binary string into an array according to the given {format}.

The unpacked data is stored in an associative array. To accomplish this you
have to name the different format codes and separate them by a slash /. If a
repeater argument is present, then each of the array keys will have a sequence
number behind the given name.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{format}

    See |pack| for an explanation of the format codes.

{data}

    The packed data.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an associative array containing unpacked elements of binary string.

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        Changes were made to bring this function into line with Perl:

        The "a" code now retains trailing NULL bytes.

5.5.0   The "A" code now strips all trailing ASCII whitespace (spaces, tabs,
        newlines, carriage returns, and NULL bytes).

        The "Z" code was added for NULL-padded strings, and removes trailing
        NULL bytes.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 unpack() example

<?php >
    $binarydata = "\x04\x00\xa0\x00";
    $array = unpack("cchars/nint", $binarydata);
<?>

The resulting array will contain the entries "chars" with value 4 and "int"
with 160.

Example #2 unpack() example with a repeater

<?php >
    $binarydata = "\x04\x00\xa0\x00";
    $array = unpack("c2chars/nint", $binarydata);
<?>

The resulting array will contain the entries "chars1", "chars2" and "int".

==============================================================================
*Notes*

Caution

Note that PHP internally stores integral values as signed. If you unpack a
large unsigned long and it is of the same size as PHP internally stored values
the result will be a negative number even though unsigned unpacking was
specified.

Caution

Be aware that if you do not name an element, an empty string is used. If you
do not name more than one element, this means that some data is overwritten as
the keys are the same such as in:

Example #3 unpack() example with unnamed keys

<?php >
    $binarydata = "\x32\x42\x00\xa0";
    $array = unpack("c2/n", $binarydata);
    var_dump($array);
<?>

The resulting array will contain the entries "1" with value 160 and "2" with
66. The first value from the c specifier is overwritten by the first value
from the n specifier.
