hw_GetText

(PHP 4)

hw_GetText â€” Retrieve text document

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int hw_gettext ( int $connection , int $objectID [, mixed $rootID/prefix~
    ] )~

Returns the document with object ID {objectID}. If the document has anchors
which can be inserted, they will be inserted already.

This function will only work for pure text documents. It will not open a
special data connection and therefore blocks the control connection during the
transfer.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    The connection identifier.

{objectID}

    The object identifier.

{rootID/prefix}

    The optional parameter {rootID/prefix} can be a string or an integer. If
    it is an integer it determines how links are inserted into the document.
    The default is 0 and will result in links that are constructed from the
    name of the link's destination object. This is useful for web
    applications. If a link points to an object with name 'internet_movie' the
    HTML link will be <A href="/internet_movie">. The actual location of the
    source and destination object in the document hierarchy is disregarded.
    You will have to set up your web browser, to rewrite that URL to for
    example '/my_script.php/internet_movie'. 'my_script.php' will have to
    evaluate $PATH_INFO and retrieve the document. All links will have the
    prefix '/my_script.php/'. If you do not want this you can set the optional
    parameter {rootID/prefix} to any prefix which is used instead. Is this
    case it has to be a string.

    If {rootID/prefix} is an integer and unequal to 0 the link is constructed
    from all the names starting at the object with the id {rootID/prefix}
    separated by a slash relative to the current object.

    If for example the above document 'internet_movie' is located at
    'a-b-c-internet_movie' with '-' being the separator between hierarchy
    levels on the Hyperwave server and the source document is located at
    'a-b-d-source' the resulting HTML link would be: <A HREF="../c/
    internet_movie">. This is useful if you want to download the whole server
    content onto disk and map the document hierarchy onto the file system.
