snmpwalkoid

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

snmpwalkoid â€” Query for a tree of information about a network entity

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array snmpwalkoid ( string $hostname , string $community , string~
    $object_id [, int $timeout = 1000000 [, int $retries = 5 ]] )~

snmpwalkoid() function is used to read all object ids and their respective
values from an SNMP agent specified by {hostname}.

The existence of snmpwalkoid() and |snmpwalk| has historical reasons. Both
functions are provided for backward compatibility. Use |snmprealwalk| instead.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{hostname}

    The SNMP agent.

{community}

    The read community.

{object_id}

    If NULL, {object_id} is taken as the root of the SNMP objects tree and all
    objects under that tree are returned as an array.

    If {object_id} is specified, all the SNMP objects below that {object_id}
    are returned.

{timeout}

    The number of microseconds until the first timeout.

{retries}

    The number of times to retry if timeouts occur.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an associative array with object ids and their respective object value
starting from the {object_id} as root or FALSE on error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 snmpwalkoid() Example

<?php >
    $a = snmpwalkoid("127.0.0.1", "public", ""); 
    for (reset($a); $i = key($a); next($a)) {
        echo "$i: $a[$i]<br />\n";
    }
<?>

Above function call would return all the SNMP objects from the SNMP agent
running on localhost. One can step through the values with a loop
