*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        As of PHP 4.3.0, the default base URI is the directory of the
4.3.0   executing script. In effect, it is the directory name value of the
        __FILE__ constant. The default base URI is less predictable with older
        versions.

    Note:

    Please note that file:// is needed in front of the path when using
    Windows.
