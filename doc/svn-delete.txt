*Description*

    bool svn_delete ( string $path [, bool $force = false ] )~

|svn_commit| on the working copy.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{path}

    Path of item to delete.

        Note: Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working
        directory was the one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling
        script's working directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

{force}

    If TRUE, the file will be deleted even if it has local modifications.
    Otherwise, local modifications will result in a failure. Default is FALSE
