dbase_open

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

dbase_open â€” Opens a database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int dbase_open ( string $filename , int $mode )~

dbase_open() opens a dBase database with the given access mode.

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or
    directories being operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script
    that is being executed.

    Note:

    This function is affected by open_basedir.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    The name of the database. It can be a relative or absolute path to the
    file where dBase will store your data.

{mode}

    An integer which correspond to those for the `open()` system call
    (Typically 0 means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2 means read and
    write).

        Note:

        You can't open a dBase file in write-only mode as the function will
        fail to read the headers information and thus you can't use 1 as
        {mode}.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Opening a dBase database file

<?php >

    // open in read-only mode
    $db = dbase_open('/tmp/test.dbf', 0);

    if ($db) {
      // read some data ..
      
      dbase_close($db);
    }

<?>

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a database link identifier if the database is successfully opened, or
FALSE if an error occurred.
