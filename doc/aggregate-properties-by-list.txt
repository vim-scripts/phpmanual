aggregate_properties_by_list â€” Selective dynamic class properties aggregation
to an object

==============================================================================
*Description*

    void aggregate_properties_by_list ( object $object , string $class_name ,~
    array $properties_list [, bool $exclude = false ] )~

Aggregates properties from a class to an existing object using a list of
property names.

The properties whose names start with an underscore character (_), which are
considered private to the aggregated class, are always excluded.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{object}

{class_name}

{properties_list}

{exclude}

    The optional parameter {exclude} is used to decide whether the list
    contains the names of class properties to include in the aggregation (i.e.
    {exclude} is FALSE), or to exclude from the aggregation ({exclude} is TRUE
    ).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

No value is returned.
