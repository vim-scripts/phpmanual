mysqlnd_ms_get_last_used_connection

(PECL mysqlnd_ms >= 1.1.0)

mysqlnd_ms_get_last_used_connection â€” Returns an array which describes the
last used connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array mysqlnd_ms_get_last_used_connection ( mixed $connection )~

Returns an array which describes the last used connection from the plugins
connection pool currently pointed to by the user connection handle. If using
the plugin, a user connection handle represents a pool of database
connections. It is not possible to tell from the user connection handles
properties to which database server from the pool the user connection handle
points.

The function can be used to debug or monitor PECL mysqlnd_ms.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    A MySQL connection handle obtained from any of the connect functions of
    the mysqli, mysql or PDO_MYSQL extensions.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

FALSE on error. Otherwise, an array which describes the connection used to
execute the last statement on.

Array which describes the connection.

   Property                          Description                       Version
               Connection scheme. Either tcp://host:port or unix://
               host:socket. If you want to distinguish connections
               from each other use a combination of scheme and
               thread_id as a unique key. Neither scheme nor thread_id
               alone are sufficient to distinguish two connections
               from each other. Two servers may assign the same        Since
scheme         thread_id to two different connections. Thus,           1.1.0.
               connections in the pool may have the same thread_id.
               Also, do not rely on uniqueness of scheme in a pool.
               Your QA engineers may use the same MySQL server
               instance for two distinct logical roles and add it
               multiple times to the pool. This hack is used, for
               example, in the test suite.
               Database server host used with the connection. The host Since
host           is only set with TCP/IP connections. It is empty with   1.1.0.
               Unix domain or Windows named pipe connections,
host_info      A character string representing the server hostname and Since
               the connection type.                                    1.1.2.
port           Database server port used with the connection.          Since
                                                                       1.1.0.
socket_or_pipe Unix domain socket or Windows named pipe used with the  Since
               connection. The value is empty for TCP/IP connections.  1.1.2.
thread_id      Connection thread id.                                   Since
                                                                       1.1.0.
               Info message obtained from the MySQL C API function     Since
last_message   mysql_info(). Please, see mysqli_info() for a           1.1.0.
               description.
errno          Error code.                                             Since
                                                                       1.1.0.
error          Error message.                                          Since
                                                                       1.1.0.
sqlstate       Error SQLstate code.                                    Since
                                                                       1.1.0.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    mysqlnd_ms_get_last_used_connection() requires PHP >= 5.4.0 and PECL
    mysqlnd_ms >> 1.1.0. Internally, it is using a mysqlnd library C call not
    available with PHP 5.3.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

The example assumes that myapp refers to a plugin configuration file section
and represents a connection pool.

Example #1 mysqlnd_ms_get_last_used_connection() example

<?php >
    $link = new mysqli("myapp", "user", "password", "database");
    $res = $link->query("SELECT 1 FROM DUAL");
    var_dump(mysqlnd_ms_get_last_used_connection($link));
<?>

The above example will output:

array(10) {
  ["scheme"]=>
  string(22) "unix:///tmp/mysql.sock"
  ["host_info"]=>
  string(25) "Localhost via UNIX socket"
  ["host"]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["port"]=>
  int(3306)
  ["socket_or_pipe"]=>
  string(15) "/tmp/mysql.sock"
  ["thread_id"]=>
  int(46253)
  ["last_message"]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["errno"]=>
  int(0)
  ["error"]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["sqlstate"]=>
  string(5) "00000"
}
