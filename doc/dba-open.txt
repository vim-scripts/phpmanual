dba_open

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

dba_open â€” Open database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource dba_open ( string $path , string $mode [, string $handler [,~
    mixed $... ]] )~

dba_open() establishes a database instance for {path} with {mode} using
{handler}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{path}

    Commonly a regular path in your filesystem.

{mode}

    It is r for read access, w for read/write access to an already existing
    database, c for read/write access and database creation if it doesn't
    currently exist, and n for create, truncate and read/write access. The
    database is created in BTree mode, other modes (like Hash or Queue) are
    not supported.

    Additionally you can set the database lock method with the next char. Use
    l to lock the database with a .lck file or d to lock the databasefile
    itself. It is important that all of your applications do this
    consistently.

    If you want to test the access and do not want to wait for the lock you
    can add t as third character. When you are absolutely sure that you do not
    require database locking you can do so by using - instead of l or d. When
    none of d, l or - is used, dba will lock on the database file as it would
    with d.

        Note:

        There can only be one writer for one database file. When you use dba
        on a web server and more than one request requires write operations
        they can only be done one after another. Also read during write is not
        allowed. The dba extension uses locks to prevent this. See the
        following table:

                                  DBA locking
        already {mode}  {mode}  {mode}  {mode}  {mode}  {mode}  {mode}  {mode}
         open   = "rl"  = "rlt" = "wl"  = "wlt" = "rd"  = "rdt" = "wd"  = "wdt"
        not     ok      ok      ok      ok      ok      ok      ok      ok
        open
        {mode}  ok      ok      wait    false   illegal illegal illegal illegal
        = "rl"
        {mode}  wait    false   wait    false   illegal illegal illegal illegal
        = "wl"
        {mode}  illegal illegal illegal illegal ok      ok      wait    false
        = "rd"
        {mode}  illegal illegal illegal illegal wait    false   wait    false
        = "wd"

          o ok: the second call will be successfull.
          o wait: the second call waits until |dba_close| is called for the
            first.
          o false: the second call returns false.
          o illegal: you must not mix "l" and "d" modifiers for {mode}
            parameter.

{handler}

    The name of the handler which shall be used for accessing {path}. It is
    passed all optional parameters given to dba_open() and can act on behalf
    of them.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a positive handle on success or FALSE on failure.

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        It's possible to open database files over network connection. However
        in cases a socket connection will be used (as with http or ftp) the
4.3.0   connection will be locked instead of the resource itself. This is
        important to know since in such cases locking is simply ignored on the
        resource and other solutions have to be found.
