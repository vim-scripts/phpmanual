db2_pclose

(PECL ibm_db2 >= 1.8.0)

db2_pclose â€” Closes a persistent database connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool db2_pclose ( resource $resource )~

This function closes a DB2 client connection created with |db2_pconnect| and
returns the corresponding resources to the database server.


    Note:

    This function is only available on i5/OS in response to i5/OS system
    administration requests.

If you have a persistent DB2 client connection created with |db2_pconnect|,
you may use this function to close the connection. To avoid substantial
connection performance penalties, this function should only be used in rare
cases when the persistent connection has become unresponsive or the persistent
connection will not be needed for a long period of time.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    Specifies an active DB2 client connection.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Closing a persistent connection

The following example demonstrates a successful attempt to close a connection
to an IBM DB2 i5/OS database.

<?php >
    $conn = db2_pconnect('', '', '');
    $rc = db2_pclose($conn);
    if ($rc) {
        echo "Connection was successfully closed.";
    }
<?>

The above example will output:

Connection was successfully closed.
