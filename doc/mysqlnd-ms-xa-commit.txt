mysqlnd_ms_xa_commit

(PECL mysqlnd_ms < 1.6.0)

mysqlnd_ms_xa_commit â€” Commits a distributed/XA transaction among MySQL
servers

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int mysqlnd_ms_xa_commit ( mixed $connection , string $gtrid )~

Commits a global transaction among MySQL servers started by 
|mysqlnd_ms_xa_begin|.

If any of the global transaction participants fails to commit an implicit
rollback is performed. It may happen that not all cases can be handled during
the rollback. For example, no attempts will be made to reconnect to a
participant after the connection to the participant has been lost. Solving
cases that cannot easily be rolled back is left to the garbage collection.

    Note: Experimental

    The feature is currently under development. There may be issues and/or
    feature limitations. Do not use in production environments.
