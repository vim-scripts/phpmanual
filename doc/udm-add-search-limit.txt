udm_add_search_limit â€” Add various search limits

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool udm_add_search_limit ( resource $agent , int $var , string $val )~

udm_add_search_limit() adds search restrictions.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{agent}

    A link to Agent, received after call to |udm_alloc_agent|.

{var}

    Defines the parameter, indicating limits. Possible {var} values:
      + UDM_LIMIT_URL - defines document URL limitations to limit the search
        through subsection of the database. It supports SQL % and _ LIKE
        wildcards, where % matches any number of characters, even zero
        characters, and _ matches exactly one character. E.g. http://
        www.example.___/catalog may stand for http://www.example.com/catalog
        and http://www.example.net/catalog.
      + UDM_LIMIT_TAG - defines site TAG limitations. In indexer-conf you can
        assign specific TAGs to various sites and parts of a site. Tags in
        mnoGoSearch 3.1.x are lines, that may contain metasymbols % and _.
        Metasymbols allow searching among groups of tags. E.g. there are links
        with tags ABCD and ABCE, and search restriction is by ABC_ - the
        search will be made among both of the tags.
      + UDM_LIMIT_LANG - defines document language limitations.
      + UDM_LIMIT_CAT - defines document category limitations. Categories are
        similar to tag feature, but nested. So you can have one category
        inside another and so on. You have to use two characters for each
        level. Use a hex number going from 0-F or a 36 base number going from
        0-Z. Therefore a top-level category like 'Auto' would be 01. If it has
        a subcategory like 'Ford', then it would be 01 (the parent category)
        and then 'Ford' which we will give 01. Put those together and you get
        0101. If 'Auto' had another subcategory named 'VW', then it's id would
        be 01 because it belongs to the 'Ford' category and then 02 because
        it's the next category. So it's id would be 0102. If VW had a sub
        category called 'Engine' then it's id would start at 01 again and it
        would get the 'VW' id 02 and 'Auto' id of 01, making it 010201. If you
        want to search for sites under that category then you pass it cat=
        010201 in the URL.
      + UDM_LIMIT_DATE - defines limitation by date the document was modified.

        Format of parameter value: a string with first character < or >, then
        with no space - date in unixtime format, for example:

        <?php >
        udm_add_search_limit($udm, UDM_LIMIT_DATE, "&lt;908012006");
<        ?>

        If > character is used, then the search will be restricted to those
        documents having a modification date greater than entered, if <, then
        smaller.

{val}

    Defines the value of the current parameter.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
