*Changelog*

Version                              Description
5.5.7   This function became available in the CLI server.
5.4.0   This function became available under FastCGI. Previously, it was
        supported only when PHP was installed as an Apache module.
4.3.3   As of PHP 4.3.3 you can use this function with the NSAPI server module
        in Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 apache_request_headers() example

<?php >
    $headers = apache_request_headers();

    foreach ($headers as $header => $value) {
        echo "$header: $value <br />\n";
    }
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
Host: www.example.com
Connection: Keep-Alive

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    You can also get at the value of the common CGI variables by reading them
    from the environment, which works whether or not you are using PHP as an 
    Apache module. Use |phpinfo| to see a list of all of the available
    environment variables.
