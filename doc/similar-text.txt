(PHP 4, PHP 5)

similar_text â€” Calculate the similarity between two strings

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int similar_text ( string $first , string $second [, float &$percent ] )~

This calculates the similarity between two strings as described in Programming
Classics: Implementing the World's Best Algorithms by Oliver (ISBN
0-131-00413-1). Note that this implementation does not use a stack as in
Oliver's pseudo code, but recursive calls which may or may not speed up the
whole process. Note also that the complexity of this algorithm is O(N**3)
where N is the length of the longest string.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{first}

    The first string.

{second}

    The second string.

{percent}

    By passing a reference as third argument, similar_text() will calculate
    the similarity in percent for you.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the number of matching chars in both strings.
