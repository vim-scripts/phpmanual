count_chars â€” Return information about characters used in a string

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed count_chars ( string $string [, int $mode = 0 ] )~

Counts the number of occurrences of every byte-value (0..255) in {string} and
returns it in various ways.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{string}

    The examined string.

{mode}

    See return values.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Depending on {mode} count_chars() returns one of the following:

  * 0 - an array with the byte-value as key and the frequency of every byte as
    value.
  * 1 - same as 0 but only byte-values with a frequency greater than zero are
    listed.
  * 2 - same as 0 but only byte-values with a frequency equal to zero are
    listed.
  * 3 - a string containing all unique characters is returned.
  * 4 - a string containing all not used characters is returned.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 count_chars() example

<?php >
    $data = "Two Ts and one F.";

    foreach (count_chars($data, 1) as $i => $val) {
       echo "There were $val instance(s) of \"" , chr($i) , "\" in the string.\n";
    }
<?>

The above example will output:

There were 4 instance(s) of " " in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "." in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "F" in the string.
There were 2 instance(s) of "T" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "a" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "d" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "e" in the string.
There were 2 instance(s) of "n" in the string.
There were 2 instance(s) of "o" in the string.
