*Parameters*

{mh}

{option}

    One of the CURLMOPT_* constants.

{value}

    The value to be set on {option}.

    {value} should be an int for the following values of the {option}
    parameter:

           Option                           Set {value} to
                         Pass 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining
                         on a multi handle will make it attempt to perform
                         HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for transfers
    CURLMOPT_PIPELINING  using this handle. This means that if you add a
                         second request that can use an already existing
                         connection, the second request will be "piped" on the
                         same connection rather than being executed in
                         parallel.
                         Pass a number that will be used as the maximum amount
                         of simultaneously open connections that libcurl may
    CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS cache. Default is 10. When the cache is full, curl
                         closes the oldest one in the cache to prevent the
                         number of open connections from increasing.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
