imap_search

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

imap_search — This function returns an array of messages matching the given
search criteria

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array imap_search ( resource $imap_stream , string $criteria [, int~
    $options = SE_FREE [, string $charset = NIL ]] )~

This function performs a search on the mailbox currently opened in the given 
IMAP stream.

For example, to match all unanswered messages sent by Mom, you'd use:
"UNANSWERED FROM mom". Searches appear to be case insensitive. This list of
criteria is from a reading of the UW c-client source code and may be
incomplete or inaccurate (see also » RFC2060, section 6.4.4).

==============================================================================

<?php >
    $conn   = imap_open('{imap.example.com:993/imap/ssl}INBOX', 'foo@example.com'
    , 'pass123', OP_READONLY);

    $some   = imap_search($conn, 
    'SUBJECT "HOWTO be Awesome" SINCE "8 August 2008"', SE_UID);
    $msgnos = imap_search($conn, 'ALL');
    $uids   = imap_search($conn, 'ALL', SE_UID);

    print_r($some);
    print_r($msgnos);
    print_r($uids);
<?>
