virtual

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

virtual â€” Perform an Apache sub-request

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool virtual ( string $filename )~

virtual() is an Apache-specific function which is similar to <!--#include
virtual...--> in mod_include. It performs an Apache sub-request. It is useful
for including CGI scripts or .shtml files, or anything else that you would
parse through Apache. Note that for a CGI script, the script must generate
valid CGI headers. At the minimum that means it must generate a Content-Type
header.

To run the sub-request, all buffers are terminated and flushed to the browser,
pending headers are sent too.

This function is only supported when PHP is installed as an Apache module.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    The file that the virtual command will be performed on.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Performs the virtual command on success, or returns FALSE on failure.

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        As of PHP 4.3.3 you can use this function with the NSAPI server module
4.3.3   in Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.

4.0.6   This function may be used on PHP files. However, it is typically
        better to use |include| or |require| for PHP files.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

See |apache_note| for an example.

*Notes*

Warning

The query string can be passed to the included file but $_GET is copied from
the parent script and only $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] is filled with the passed
query string. The query string may only be passed when using Apache 2. The
requested file will not be listed in the Apache access log.

    Note:

    Environment variables set in the requested file are not visible to the
    calling script.
