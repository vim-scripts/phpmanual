pcntl_waitpid

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5)

pcntl_waitpid â€” Waits on or returns the status of a forked child

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int pcntl_waitpid ( int $pid , int &$status [, int $options = 0 ] )~

Suspends execution of the current process until a child as specified by the
{pid} argument has exited, or until a signal is delivered whose action is to
terminate the current process or to call a signal handling function.

If a child as requested by {pid} has already exited by the time of the call (a
so-called "zombie" process), the function returns immediately. Any system
resources used by the child are freed. Please see your system's waitpid(2) man
page for specific details as to how waitpid works on your system.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{pid}

    The value of {pid} can be one of the following:

                          possible values for {pid}
    <   wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to the
    -1  absolute value of {pid}.
    -1  wait for any child process; this is the same behaviour that the wait
        function exhibits.
    0   wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of
        the calling process.
    > 0 wait for the child whose process ID is equal to the value of {pid}.

        Note:

        Specifying -1 as the {pid} is equivalent to the functionality 
        |pcntl_wait| provides (minus {options}).

{status}

    pcntl_waitpid() will store status information in the {status} parameter
    which can be evaluated using the following functions: |pcntl_wifexited|, 
    |pcntl_wifstopped|, |pcntl_wifsignaled|, |pcntl_wexitstatus|, 
    |pcntl_wtermsig| and |pcntl_wstopsig|.

{options}

    The value of {options} is the value of zero or more of the following two
    global constants OR'ed together:

                        possible values for {options}
    WNOHANG   return immediately if no child has exited.
    WUNTRACED return for children which are stopped, and whose status has not
              been reported.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

pcntl_waitpid() returns the process ID of the child which exited, -1 on error
or zero if WNOHANG was used and no child was available
