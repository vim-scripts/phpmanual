sybase_pconnect

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

sybase_pconnect â€” Open persistent Sybase connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource sybase_pconnect ([ string $servername [, string $username [,~
    string $password [, string $charset [, string $appname ]]]]] )~

sybase_pconnect() acts very much like |sybase_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (
|sybase_close| will not close links established by sybase_pconnect()).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{servername}

    The servername argument has to be a valid servername that is defined in
    the 'interfaces' file.

{username}

    Sybase user name

{password}

    Password associated with {username}.

{charset}

    Specifies the charset for the connection

{appname}

    Specifies an appname for the Sybase connection. This allow you to make
    separate connections in the same script to the same database. This may
    come handy when you have started a transaction in your current connection,
    and you need to be able to do a separate query which cannot be performed
    inside this transaction.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a positive Sybase persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
error.
