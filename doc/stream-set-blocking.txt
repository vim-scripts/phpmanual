stream_set_blocking

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5)

stream_set_blocking â€” Set blocking/non-blocking mode on a stream

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool stream_set_blocking ( resource $stream , int $mode )~

Sets blocking or non-blocking mode on a {stream}.

This function works for any stream that supports non-blocking mode (currently,
regular files and socket streams).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{stream}

    The stream.

{mode}

    If {mode} is 0, the given stream will be switched to non-blocking mode,
    and if 1, it will be switched to blocking mode. This affects calls like 
    |fgets| and |fread| that read from the stream. In non-blocking mode an 
    |fgets| call will always return right away while in blocking mode it will
    wait for data to become available on the stream.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    This function was previously called as |set_socket_blocking| and later 
    |socket_set_blocking| but this usage is deprecated.

==============================================================================

  * |stream_select| - Runs the equivalent of the select() system call on the
    given arrays of streams with a timeout specified by tv_sec and tv_usec
