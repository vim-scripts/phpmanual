Returns the number of hits for the last search or 0 if no search was
performed.

The search result array (if supplied) holds information that is returned by a
Z39.50 server in the SearchResult-1 format part of a search response. The
SearchResult-1 format can be used to obtain information about hit counts for
various parts of the query (subquery). In particular, it is possible to obtain
hit counts for the individual search terms in a query. Information for first
subquery is in $array[0], second subquery in $array[1], and so forth.
