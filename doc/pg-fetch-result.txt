*Description*

    string pg_fetch_result ( resource $result , int $row , mixed $field )~
    string pg_fetch_result ( resource $result , mixed $field )~

pg_fetch_result() returns the value of a particular row and field (column) in
a PostgreSQL result resource.

    Note:

    This function used to be called pg_result().

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{result}

    PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|, |pg_query_params
    | or |pg_execute| (among others).

{row}

    Row number in result to fetch. Rows are numbered from 0 upwards. If
    omitted, next row is fetched.

{field}

    A string representing the name of the field (column) to fetch, otherwise
    an int representing the field number to fetch. Fields are numbered from 0
    upwards.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Boolean is returned as "t" or "f". All other types, including arrays are
returned as strings formatted in the same default PostgreSQL manner that you
would see in the `psql` program. Database NULL values are returned as NULL.

FALSE is returned if {row} exceeds the number of rows in the set, or on any
other error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 pg_fetch_result() example

<?php >
    $db = pg_connect("dbname=users user=me") || die();

    $res = pg_query($db, "SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2");

    $val = pg_fetch_result($res, 1, 0);

    echo "First field in the second row is: ", $val, "\n";
<?>

The above example will output:

First field in the second row is: 2
